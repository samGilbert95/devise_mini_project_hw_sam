## Sparta Devise Mini Project


### Description
---
This project tasked me with developing a webpage using the knowledge gained from my week working with ruby on rails.
### Tech used
---
##### Languages
Ruby and Rails were used for the structure, Bootstrap was used for styling

### Challenges
---
I found myself facing many errors during this project, which i was fortunately able to overcome. However, I was unable to work out why I was unable to connect resources to the asset pipeline. Whenever I would try, it would cause the site to crash.

~~~sass
### Imports failing
 // @import 'general/fonts';
 // @import 'general/color-scheme';
 // @import 'partials/nav';
~~~
### Takeaways
---
My theoretical knowledge of SCSS and the asset pipeline are better than before, however, I am still confused as to their practical setups
